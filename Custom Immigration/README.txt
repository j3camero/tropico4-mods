Description

This mod alters the way in which immigration is handled by the game. The source country an immigrant comes from is no longer picked equally at random amongst a list of countries. The globe is split into four regions (Caribbean, Europe, Americas, and Asia). Each region has a corresponding list of nations.

To determine the source country the game will first pick at random one of the four regions. Each region has it's own probability of being selected. By default 40% will come from the Caribbean, 40% from Europe, 10% from Americas, and 10% from Asia.

Once a region is picked the game will then choose a nation from that region. Each nation within a region also has it's own probability of being selected. By default (with the Ireland pack) in the Europe region: 20% will come from England, 20% from France, 20% from Germany, 10% from Ireland, 10% from Italy, 10% from Spain, and 10% from USSR.

Regional and Nation probability can be altered by editing the mod file's config section.

This mod also alters the way in which a child's origin is determined. Children born in Tropico will still associate their origin with their parents for a few generations. Their names will be chosen based on their associated origin.

By default: Children will inherit their father's origin unless either parent is a native of Tropico. After two generations children born will be considered Tropican.

How the child inherits can be altered by editing the mod file's config section.

In addition to the main file there are also Nation Packs. Each pack adds a nation and a custom name list to the game.
