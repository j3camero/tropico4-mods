Author: DarthPresidente

Requires:  Modern Times DLC

Allows the quick destruction of buildings.  To use hold the SHIFT key while
selecting a building to destroy.  This will make the game bypass the normal
process of sending a construction worker out to the building to set the
explosives, then detonating the explosives.  Instead the building will be
destroyed shortly after you exit the demolish tool.

Installation:
Unzip the files (except this readme.txt) into your Tropico 4 folder.  Multiple copies of the mod are
included in different folders to accommodate users with different combinations
of DLC content
