QuickDestroy Snippet
by DarthPresidente

Requires:  Modern Times DLC

Use:

Allows the quick destruction of buildings.  To use hold the SHIFT key while
selecting a building to destroy.  This will make the game bypass the normal
process of sending a construction worker out to the building to set the 
explosives, then detonating the explosives.  Instead the building will be
destroyed shortly after you exit the demolish tool.

Installation:

Unzip the files (except this readme.txt) into your Tropico 4 folder.  Multiple copies of the mod are
included in different folders to accommodate users with different combinations
of DLC content


Your folder structure should look like...

Tropico 4\EastPoint\game\QuickDestroy.lua
Tropico 4\ex\game\QuickDestroy.lua
Tropico 4\NuclearTakedown\game\QuickDestroy.lua
Tropico 4\Propaganda\game\QuickDestroy.lua
Tropico 4\Voodoo\game\QuickDestroy.lua
