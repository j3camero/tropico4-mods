Requires: Modern Times

What it does:
Changes Bio farms so they can produce a specific crop type or Foodcrops.
I had to eliminate Cashcrops because the UI is designed to allow for a max of 8 work modes and I am too lazy to mod that.
WARNING: Using a mod voids eligibility for customer support from the game publisher.

To Use: Place the file AltBioFarms.lua in your Tropico 4\Game folder. You may need to create the "Game" folder.
