Allows overlapping roads by holding the CTRL button down when using the build road tool.  No more painstakingly placing roads to take advantage of a glitch to place overlapping roads. And look! Curved overlapping roads!

WARNING: Using a mod voids eligibility for customer support from the game publisher.

To Use: place RoadCheat.lua in your "Tropico 4\Game" folder. You may need to create the "Game" folder.

Alternative Version (RoadCheat - Extended Paved Roads):
Paved roads extend a LOT farther from buildings. Might be a performance hit!
