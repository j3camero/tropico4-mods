LockNot mod for Modern Times

What it can do:
Change the year a modern time building becomes available
Keep old buildings available after the Modern Times building becomes available. Old buildings are accessed by holding down the SHIFT button while clicking on the category in the build menu.
Impose a retrofit cost in the form of a blueprint on the old buildings. This does not affect buildings already built.
Impose an additional cost on older buildings
All of the above can be easily altered by editing the mod's config section. The default config does not change the start year for buildings, allows all the old buildings, imposes a retrofit and build cost of about 25% of the building's original cost.

WARNING: Using a mod voids eligibility for customer support from the game publisher.

To Use: Place the file LockNot.lua in your Tropico 4\Game folder. You may need to create the "Game" folder.

This MOD is in the testing stage yet. I'm looking for feedback and errors. When posting errors be as specific as possible and include any relevant information from your game's log file. Log files are stored in: "%appdata%\Tropico 4\logs" Please enclose log file data in [ code ] tags.
